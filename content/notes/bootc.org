#+TITLE: Bootc and Rhel Image Mode
#+DATE: <2025-06-15 Sun>

TL;DR: RedHat announced this at summit, I thought its finally ready for prod,
started using it everywhere and realized how underdeveloped the ecosystem is,
and decided to dump my experiences here.

IMHO some if not most of the stuff here, such as the transient etc woes should
be handled by the base images themselves, rather than leaving them out for the
user with minimal warning.

These were originally written as notes/brain dump. The context is that I am
trying to make a Slurm/Jupyter notebook cluster for my student org.

** Use transient everything, especially transient /etc, otherwise:
  
- Files created manually stay in /etc forever, can't edir or delete via
  container upgrade.

- Don't want to lose control over system, container should be source of truth.

- Transient etc (and everything else) is the only way to ensure changes to the
  container ACTUALLY propogate, are installed and functional.
  + Harder to reason about change propogation in non-transient systems.

- No point using this technology without transient/composefs root ie =/=

** Transient etc gotchas

- Note that SELinux will have a stroke because of all this /etc and /var
  business. I turn it off completely.

- Note also that while etc is transient at runtime, it is mutable and persistent
  and container build time, ie in the Containerfile

- SSH Host keys will re-gen on reboot!
  + Use HostKey directive in config, store keys in /var
  + I made a service override for =sshd-keygen@.service= to call my script,
    which is a copy of the original but makes the keys in /var
    * Note that atleast on centos-stream9-bootc a systemd target
      =sshd-keygen.target= exists, which ~wants~ the units =sshd-keygen@ed25519=
      etc. An alternative is to kill this altogether target and make keys
      manually with a shell script.

- Machine ID is lost
  + Apparently this is important for systemd
  + Use tmpfiles.d to store initial machine id in var, make symlink.

- Repeat for /etc/hostname. I'd recommend injecting the hostname to /var from a
  installer shell script as the kickstart/anaconda settings will be lost
  (more on this later)

- Use =systemd-firstboot= to setup locale and keymap and etc.
  + Note that this can't be used for hostname as that is different per-machine.
  + Install dnf package =langpacks-en= to get locale =en_US.UTF-8=

- Use /var for machine specific files

- Systemd Tricks:
  + Use `/etc/systemd/service/foo.service.d/something.conf` to override existing
    services.
  + While overriding, need to set list-able value to blank to overwrite.  Eg.
    #+BEGIN_SRC conf
      ExecStart=
      ExecStart= new-script.sh
    #+END_SRC
  + Run systemctl enable in Containerfile to create symlinks for activating on
    boot
    * Alternative is to manually make symlinks under `multi-user.target.wants`
      dir etc.

  + Manually make .mount files as kickstart is kinda ass.

  + Mount file names __MUST__ be the same as the ~Where=~ field! Use
    ~systemd-escape -p /some/path~ to name units!
    * Eg. mount for ~Where=/boot/efi~ must be named ~boot-efi.mount~
    * Failing to do this will cause systemd to "refuse" the mount.

  + Use ~ConditionFileExists~ and co in Unit section to make one-time files like
    ssh host keys

** Kickstart gotchas

- Transient etc will make stuff from kickstart NOT persist! Eg root password,
  hostname, fstab

- Use kickstart to make partitions, install and run a shell script to inject
  secrets and state like hostname to /var, then use tmpfiles.d to make symlinks!

- Do NOT refer to PyKickstart manual, use Rhel9 docs Appendix!

- Kickstart with autopart will happily make you a BIOS MBR system. MUST do
  manual partitioning!

- Hack: Use file system labels while making partitions in kickstart, then use
  ~What=LABEL=foo~ in systemd mount file.

- Ostree/bootc commands will NOT work at all if ~/boot/loader~ is missing.
  + You can have a efi booted system, but that does not mean /boot and/or
    /boot/efi is **mounted** at runtime.

- Do NOT use ~bootloader~ verb! It either does the wrong thing, or I am holding
  it wrong...

- Manually specify file system type unless cool with default xfs.

** OSTree observations
- Whole system is a web of (bind) mounts. Bind mounts in bootc = symlinks in
  NixOS.

- Systemd service ~ostree-finalize-staged.service~ runs on shutdown, which
  "finalizes" the state of /etc and doing the 3-way merge stuff.
  + Stop this service if you want to forget changes to etc (when in non
    transient etc)
  + This runs the currently undocumented command ~ostree admin finalize-staged~

- /var is populated once at first boot and never again. Do NOT rely on OSTree to
  fix your mistakes in /var!

- That said, a pristine /var does exist under /sysroot or /ostree for manual
  rsync'ing.

- For non transient etc, ~ostree admin config-diff~ will show how etc has
  diverged from the container image.

- Current OSTree tooling is too poor to reliably rollback commits and/or restore
  files IMO. In the future ideally it should let you deal with the rootfs like
  a git repo.
  

** Containerfile and general tips

- What's a Dockerfile?

- Build layer caching and invalidation works top down, ie if something a layer
  at the TOP of the file has changed, all layers below are rebuilt and not used
  from cache!
  + Make layers in Decreasing order of likelihood of change - with stuff that
    you wont need to change towards the top

  + Work in progress - Use multi-stage builds, maybe docker buildkit.

- There are no background daemons running in the container build.
  + Make systemd oneshot units to run commands that need a daemon or running
    system.

- Use drop-in ~conf.d~ directories for all software that supports them, which is
  mostly all relevant software. Makes it easier to manage, and in case of non
  transient etc probably helps with the 3-way going in your favour.

- MAKE SURE to match or be mindful of file permissions (mode and ownership)
  created via the container. Software may REQUIRE particular permissions!
  + Use chown/chmod ~--reference=~ to copy mode and perms of existing file.

- Add Kernel cmdline arguments by creating toml files with key "kargs" and value
  string array in ~/usr/lib/bootc/kargs.d/~
  + A good one is ~kargs = ["selinux=0"]~

- Remember to =chmod +x= stuff you want to execute! I do it in the
  Containerfile.

- Use ~usermod --password~ to set the password hash for the root user.

- DKMS will not work at runtime due to immutability. Use this in Containerfile:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    kver=$(cd /usr/lib/modules; echo *); /usr/sbin/dkms autoinstall --verbose
    --kernelver "$kver"
  #+END_SRC
  This will ensure dkms modules are compiled and installed at build time.
  + dkms.service is disabled by default!

- Work in progress: Do not use =realmd= as it wants to edit a bunch of files in
  immutable/transient directories.
  + Configure sssd manually
  + Use =adcli= to do the domain joining, set location for krb5.keytab in /var
  + Figure a way to run =authselect= in Containerfile, or perhaps on every boot.
  + Investigate realmd install root cli option.

** Nvidia Misery
- Containerfile from fedora bootc examples doesn't work (for me atleast).
  + Doesn't install the actual kernel module

- Enable cuda-rhel9 repo, and enable module =nvidia-driver:latest-dkms=
  + Non-DKMS did not work for me, gave ugly dependency hell errors.

- Install packages "nvidia-driver-cuda" and "kmod-nvidia-latest-dkms"
  + These are the proprietary ones, haven't looked into the open ones.

- Build DKMS module using aforementioned trick

- Add kernel cmdline argument to blacklist nouveau

- Probably rebuild initramfs.
