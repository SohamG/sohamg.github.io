#+TITLE: JavaScript is LITERALLY GARBAGE


* PLEASE STOP USING JAVASCRIPT

Reasons to stop using JavaScript

1. Because I said so.

2. More reasons are left as an exercise to the reader.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<script defer>
addEventListener("load", () => {
while (1) {
setTimeout(() => {  console.log("JS BAD!"); }, 500);
}
})
</script>
#+END_EXPORT
