#+TITLE: JavaScript is LITERALLY GARBAGE


* PLEASE STOP USING JAVASCRIPT

** Reasons to stop using JavaScript

1. Because I said so.

2. More reasons are left as an exercise to the reader.


* Can != Should

Just because you **CAN** use javascript doesn't mean you **SHOULD**!!

NO, your personal blog doesn't need _REACT JS_!

* What in the hell is a build tool?!

**WHY** do I need a build tool to use basically any javascript??

* THIS WEBSITE USES JAVASCRIPT

And it will probably crash by the time you're done reading!

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<script async>
addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
while (1) {
setTimeout(() => {  console.log("JS BAD!"); }, 500);
}
})
</script>
#+END_EXPORT
